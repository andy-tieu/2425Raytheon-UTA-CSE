To run this program, ensure that the Raspberry Pi is updated to latest version. (New RPi OS's should have mostly everything installed automatically)
Ensure that the Pi camera module is connected to the Raspberry Pi and the config.txt file in /boot/firmware/ is edited to include the camera_autodetect=0 and dtoverlay=imx708 in the section marked as [all].
Install the latest version of OpenCV by running the command 'sudo apt install -y python3-opencv' and 'sudo apt install -y opencv-data'.
Once everything is set up properly, the program can be run by either terminal or a code editor.
